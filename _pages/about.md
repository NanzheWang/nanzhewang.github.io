Hello! I'm Nanzhe Wang, an Assistant Professor at Heriot-Watt University in the UK. Before joining Heriot-Watt, I was a Postdoctoral Scholar in the Department of Energy Science and Engineering at **Stanford University**, working with [Prof. Louis J. Durlofsky](https://profiles.stanford.edu/louis-durlofsky). I earned my PhD in Energy and Resources Engineering from **Peking University**, advised by [Prof. Dongxiao Zhang](https://www.coe.pku.edu.cn/teaching/academician/10475.html), and my Bachelor’s degree in Petroleum Engineering from the **China University of Petroleum (Beijing)**.

My research focuses on **sustainable geoenergy development and subsurface resource management**, with particular emphasis on **uncertainty quantification, data assimilation, and decision-making for subsurface flow systems**. Key application areas include geological carbon storage, geothermal energy extraction, hydrocarbon production, and water resource management. My work integrates **AI models, numerical simulations, probabilistic algorithms and multi-source data** to advance intelligent, safe, and efficient subsurface energy and resource management practices, contributing to a more sustainable and secure energy future.
